# Learning-PIML-in-Python-PINNs-DeepONets-RBA

Hi, Iâ€™m Juan Diego Toscano. Thanks for stopping by.

This repository will help you to get involved in the physics-informed machine learning world. Inside the Tutorials folders, you will find several step-by-step guides on the basic concepts required to run and understand  Physics-informed Machine Learning models (from approximating functions, solving and discovering ODE/PDEs with PINNs,  to solving parametric PDEs with DeepONets). 

Also, for advanced users, you can find our latest research in PINNs to achieve state-of-the-art performance using residual-based attention (RBA).

I reviewed some of these problems on my YouTube channel, so please watch them if you have time.
